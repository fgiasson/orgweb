* =.orgwebignore=

A target folder is often full of artifact that will never contains any tangled
files to detangle, or detangled files to tangle. We can think of virtual
environment folders, build folders, etc.

However, there are files and folders that will appear in a =.gitignore= file
that have been tangled or detangled.

For that reason, we cannot simply use =.gitignore= file to see if we try to
tangle/detangle a file from a directory.

This is why we created a new file called =.orgwebignore=. This file follows the
same specification than a =.gitignore= file, but the files will most likely
ignore a different set of files, since their purpose is different.

Every =orgweb= command takes that ignore file into consideration to perform
those actions.

#+begin_src python
def orgweb_ignored(file: str, folder: str) -> bool:
    """Check for a .orgwebignore file in `folder`. Check if `file` needs to be
    ignored accordingt to the .orgwebignore file. True if it is ignored, False
    otherwise."""

    # make sure `folder` ends with a '/'
    folder = folder.rstrip('/') + '/'

    # if there is no .gitignore file, then nothing is ignored
    if not os.path.isfile(f"{folder}.orgwebignore"):
        return False

    matches = parse_gitignore(f"{folder}.orgwebignore")
    return matches(f"{folder}{file}")
