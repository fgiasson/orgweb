#+TITLE: Emacs Install.el

=install.el= is used by the Dockerfile to easily install all required packages
in Emacs. It is simpler and cleaner to maintain that ELisp file instead of
adding a bunch of =RUN= commands with =emacs= command line calls.


* Configure MELPA

Many major modes are only available on MELPA and not in ELPA, we we have to add
it to the vanilla Emacs instance.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'package) 

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)

(package-initialize) 
(package-refresh-contents)
#+end_src

* Install Packages

If you need new package to handle non-default major modes for your Org file,
this is where you add them. Once you added them, you will have to =make
rebuild-local= and to delete the previous Docker image in your Docker
environment. Finally, the next time you rerun =weborg= then the new Docker image
will be created and the new mode will be available to Org mode.

#+begin_src elisp
(package-install 'use-package)
(package-install 'yaml-mode)
(package-install 'dockerfile-mode)
(package-install 'terraform-mode)
(package-install 'graphviz-dot-mode)
(package-install 'plantuml-mode)
(package-install 'toml-mode)
